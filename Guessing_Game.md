# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback based on the user's guess and the threshold value.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guess when prompted by the program.
4. The program will provide feedback based on your guess:
   - If your guess is correct, it will display "Brilliant! You Guessed the Number Correctly."
   - If your guess is within a threshold value of 5 of the random number, it will display "Hey! You got so close. One more time" along with the actual random number.
   - If your guess is 0, it will display "Thank you for playing. Goodbye!" and the program will exit.
   - If your guess is not correct and not within the threshold, it will display "Hey! One more time. It's far" along with the actual random number.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you guess the correct number or enter 0 to exit.
